# Price-Prediction-with-ANN-in-PyTorch
**Objective**:
This project builds a linear regression model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in PyTorch to predict property prices based on area. 

**Dataset Description**:
This Dataset consists of 12 features and an output. The 12 features are:
Area: The area of the house (numerical high ranges)
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house (numerical)
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house (numerical)
Stories: How many stories does this house have (numerical)
Mainroad: Does the house have a main road or not (non-numerical)
Guestroom: Whether there a guest room (non-numerical)
Basement: Whether there is a basement (non-numerical)
Hotwaterheating: whether there is hot water in the house or not (non-numerical)
Airconditioning: if there is an airconditioning it is a yes (non-numerical)
Parking: how many parking (numerical)
Prefarea: there is a pref area or not (non-numerical)
Furnishingstatus: Whether the house is furnished, semi-furnished, or not furnished (non-numerical)

The output of the dataset is the prices of the house and that's our target

**Steps to run the code**:
1. Download the ipynb file and the dataset file.
2. Upload the notebook on Colab then upload the dataset.
3. Run the whole code to see the results by yourself.
   
**Dependencies**:
