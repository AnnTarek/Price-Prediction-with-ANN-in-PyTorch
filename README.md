# Price-Prediction-with-ANN-in-PyTorch
**Objective**:
This project builds a linear regression model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in PyTorch to predict property prices based on area. 

**Dataset Description**:
This Dataset consists of 12 features and an output. The 12 features are: <br> 
Area: The area of the house (numerical high ranges) <br> 
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house (numerical) <br> 
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house (numerical) <br> 
Stories: How many stories does this house have (numerical)<br> 
Mainroad: Does the house have a main road or not (non-numerical) <br> 
Guestroom: Whether there a guest room (non-numerical) <br> 
Basement: Whether there is a basement (non-numerical) <br> 
Hotwaterheating: whether there is hot water in the house or not (non-numerical) <br> 
Airconditioning: if there is an airconditioning it is a yes (non-numerical) <br> 
Parking: how many parking (numerical) <br> 
Prefarea: there is a pref area or not (non-numerical) <br> 
Furnishingstatus: Whether the house is furnished, semi-furnished, or not furnished (non-numerical) <br> 

The output of the dataset is the prices of the house and that's our target
